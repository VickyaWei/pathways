Prior to attending UC Santa Barbara for my PhD, I interned at several aerospace companies or interest areas, and I also worked at NASA. Following these internships and NASA educational experiences, I went to Guyana, South America, where my dad is from, and for a couple hours, we didn't have water because a pipe broke and there's no centralized water in the country. So that's really where my focus more on water came to play and also thinking about under served communities. So really, that really pushed my interest or at least continued it in pushing for diversity and higher education, not only for the diversity of thought, but also for the diversity in research when it comes to developing all these technologies. So, that's who I am.",

Currently, my job is to take care of all the functions that occur within the water district, including water and wastewater systems, managing our board of directors and our public committees as well as our interfaces with local governments near and far and managing all regulatory aspects. There's a lot of a lot of things that fall in the umbrella.

So I ended up switching to Computer Science because that was what I was very passionate about. And then um from there when I graduated, I joined Google through the Cloud Tech Residency program and I had to move to Austin for that. And um from there like um I rotated into three different roles, so customer engineering, and then the next rotation had technical account manager, consulting and strategic cloud engineer, and then the final rotation was technical solution engineer. And after the program I was out placed into customer engineering. And then from there um I had to move to the Bay Area and then um during COVID I moved back to Orange County. And then um from there I ended up transferring, I had to re-interview and then transfer um into UX Engineering. So yeah and then that's where my passion lies more, in UX Engineering too.",
