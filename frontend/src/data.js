So that's really where my focus more on water came to play and also thinking about under served communities. So really, that really pushed my interest or at least continued it in pushing for diversity and higher education, not only for the diversity of thought, but also for the diversity in research when it comes to developing all these technologies.

My interest in science began actually with a fish tank - I accidentally bought a pregnant fish from the pet store and it had a bunch of babies overnight, so it was kind of crazy. I started college actually as a film major but then as time went on with my fish, I was like, well, I think I should try marine biology. So, I did my undergrad at the California State University, Fullerton and majored in biology with a concentration in marine science and at that time I studied algae. I was in a marine lab where they looked at algae in the rocky intertidal which was really fun. And then I moved on to my master's at Cal State L.A. and there I studied plants. Now I'm at UCI doing my PhD continuing my education and continuing on with plants this time. And right now, I'm really interested in understanding how plants respond to drought and climate change, and particularly agricultural plants. Yeah, so, nice to meet you and let me know if you have any questions!",

I grew up in Northern California. I am 100% Portuguese, and I moved down south to go strictly to school. Uh Well before Cal State Fullerton even had dorms on campus, I lived at some off-site housing and met some long-life friends at Cal State Fullerton. So I've worked in a few industries currently I work for Coalfire uh not coal fired pizza but uh Coalfire offers a lot of cybersecurity solutions. I am actually a senior consultant in the compliance advisory group. I work strictly on compliance and advising clients how to uh submit to security requirements, how to prepare for certifications and just educating them on the practices of security in um cloud environments and just everything in between really. I didn't always work in cybersecurity, that's recently in the last probably six or seven years; prior to joining cybersecurity, I worked in insurance, and I started my career as a claims adjuster, learning everything I could and advancing into faud investigations. And then later I worked my way up into being a subject matter expert, doing some training, also managing some teams uh and then taking over some compliance um different programs and things like that, managing those. So coupled with my fraud background, uh retail security, credit card fraud investigation, employee investigations, I kind of have ended up in a career in cybersecurity. So, it's an exciting time. The pandemic obviously created a lot of issues for a lot of companies, a lot of cyber issues. And so it's just a growing time, it's uh profitable industry right now, and uh once companies submit to cyber requirements and cybersecurity standards, they really kind of can't decide that they're not going to pursue those and keep those certifications up. So, it's a great time to be entering um cybersecurity world, and if you don't know anything about Coalfire, check it out. And if you have any other questions, reach out, and I'd love to help anyone. I kind of struggled when I got out of school, I had a college degree, it was kind of a recession and I had to pay my dues and in those days we didn't have a lot of networking like opportunities that we have now with the Internet and LinkedIn and alumni services and this portal. Right, this is a great resource. So if I can help you um you know, let me know, I'd be happy to give you my opinion or make a recommendation. So all right, thanks, nice meeting you. ",

After that, I decided that I wanted to live in a place where I never had the shovel snow, so my first real practice was in California. It was important to me at one point to be my own boss. And so I actually moved to Texas and practiced in a small solo private practice for three years. I learned then that being my own boss was not exactly what was going to be best for my career. So my husband and I moved back to California, where I've practiced medicine for the last 30 years.

I'm also on the board of directors of the San Diego County Water Authority, which is the main water wholesaler for the county of San Diego. I also served in various roles with the standing of Local Agency Formation Commission as well as the California Special Districts Association. Rainbow Municipal Water District serves the largely agricultural but growing residential area in the Northern San Diego County along I-15 and we used to be the avocado capital of the world and that were primarily turning into homes. So, it's been an interesting transition. Um I graduated in 2000 with a master's in public administration from Cal State Fullerton and that that came after my bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from San Diego State University in the late 80s. Currently, my job is to take care of all the functions that occur within the water district, including water and wastewater systems, managing our board of directors and our public committees as well as our interfaces with local governments near and far and managing all regulatory aspects. There's a lot of a lot of things that fall in the umbrella. But the thing I enjoy doing most is helping develop and produce great professionals out of the people who come to work for us and that's one of the most challenging parts of the job.",

So, right now, I am a doctoral student in a Clinical Psychology program on the Child track at the University of Houston, but my path was definitely not linear. Um, I had some ups and downs along the way and so I'll tell you a little bit about that history. I went to Saint Louis University, and I got my Bachelor's in Science in Psychology. I also minored in Spanish and biology, as I started out pre-med. I was planning to become a psychiatrist and after some physician shadowing, I decided to switch. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, and I needed a job, uh to pay for college. I am a- a first-generation college student from a low-income background. So I got a job as a substitute teacher, and I was hoping that I might learn a bit about, uh what kind of job I might want if I wanted to become an educator. And I learned that I didn't want to, uh, become a elementary, middle school, high school teacher, but that experience was really informative, and it gave me some money along the way. I also got some research experience. I was in the McNair Scholars Program, which was super beneficial for professional development. Um, so I'm happy to, um, provide context on that. After undergrad, I went on to become a, uh, English teaching assistant with Fulbright through Columbia. So, I was working there, improving my Spanish, and also teaching English, and I was able to get some more research experience there. Um, I did apply for grad school my senior year of college, didn't get in, reapplied while I was in Colombia, and eventually I applied for a bunch of programs, and I got into the University of Houston, and I'm very grateful it's a really great opportunity. Um, I'm very happy there and very happy to talk about, uh, the application process and, uh, really how I came to the decision that I wanted to apply for a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) in clinical psychology. Really happy to answer all your questions.",
